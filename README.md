# Chat between 2 esp32s

## Description
I conducted this session when I was a coordinator in electronics club.
We explained the students, who were freshers, about wireless communication and made a chatting feature between 2 esp32s
So in the session we made half the students write client's code and the other half the server's code.
We brought our WiFi Router and made everyone connect to it. 
The students had to first get the ip address of their system after connecting to the network, which is then anoynmously shared to the other person they chat to.
It was kept anonymous who had the ip address of whom so that the chatting was incognito and it was so much fun.</br></br>
