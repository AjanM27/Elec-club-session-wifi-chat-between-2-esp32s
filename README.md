# Chat between 2 esp32s

## Description
I conducted this session when I was a coordinator in electronics club.
We explained the students, who were freshers, about wireless communication and made a chatting feature between 2 esp32s
So in the session we made half the students write client's code and the other half the server's code.
We brought our WiFi and made everyone connect to it. 
It was kept anonymous who had the password of whom so that the chatting was incognito and it was so much fun.
